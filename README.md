# Karl's dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. Installation is handled by a few lines of bash (mostly `ln -s` and `cp`). After installation, git is used to keep it in sync across computers without any additional tools.

The largest part of this repo is configuration for
* vim
* tmux
* bash
* git

### Clone and Setup
 
```sh
git clone git@github.com:karlb/dotfiles.git ~/.myconfig && ~/.myconfig/install.sh
```
